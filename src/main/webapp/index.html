      <h1>Eulerity Take-Home Challenge: Image Scraping Web Crawler</h1>
      <p>
        The crawler will take longer for more complex sites (so please be
        patient after clicking the button). Runtimes for specific websites are
        provided in
        <b>text-links.txt</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <i>MAX_DEPTH</i> variable can also be changed in
        <b>Crawler.java</b> to decrease/increase the number of pages you would
        like to crawl.
      </p>
      <p>
        After crawling is done, the full JSON array can also be seen in the
        console (press F12 > console).
      </p>
      <p>Logos or icons are also specified with a caption under the image (not 100% successful).</p>
      <p>
        Note: if duplicate images are displayed, the website has their
        logos/icons as img elements on every page.
